                <h1>Welcome to UMEED :-</h1>
                <p>UMEED, India’s most trusted NGO, has been working towards visually challenged education, training,
                    employment, livelihood and support services for more than 35 years. Thanks to the support of people
                    like you, we’ve impacted over 30000+ visually challenged in India

                    But we have miles to go and need your help. India is home to a third of the world’s blind
                    population. The country has about 12 million individuals with visual impairment as against the
                    global total of 39 million. Despite this, when it comes to accessibility of education, healthcare
                    and employment, the visually impaired are cut-off. Only 29.16 percent of the blind in India are part
                    of the education system as per a survey conducted by the (NCERT). The same survey points out that
                    only 6.86 percent of schools have access to braille books and audio content.

                    Donate to UMEED to give visually challenged a confidence in them for their future. Your small
                    contribution will make a big difference in their lives.</p>
